# MainWebsite
The main website for ProtoStart.

Code to replace our current WordPress site at protostart.net at some point. 
The idea is, this will be a community built website - by our community just for the needs of our community!

We also have a parked domain protostarter.com that we can use as a staging area. We'll use it to get this version pubicly online when it's good to show to people, but not quite ready to replace the wordpress site. When it's ready to replace the WordPress site PGDesign put up as a temporary site, we will.

Rough plan as it stands: - letters indicate split paths that join up again later
1a) Get some boilerplate stuff together in this repo, - DONE
1b) Get something online at protostart.net - DONE (did it this way, so that we made visible progress, and also so that I could focus on UX design separately from code)
2b) Improve what was online, to make a really good homepage for us - DONE
3b) Add a bit more content to the live site (so it describes what we're about and shows that we've got projects people can help with) - DONE
4a) Make a permanant homepage for protostarter.com that explains it is our staging area and contains the latest stuff we're working on. It will always link to the latest alpha/beta versions of all our web based projects, including any redesigns of protostart.net - First draft complete, reviewed a different day - some improvements made, 
5a) In a directory or subdomain of the staging area: recreate, and maybe improve upon what is viewable at protostart.net Can use libraries or a more dev friendly CMS than WordPress, or maybe we can extend WP to fit us better?? There must be some way of having a CMS that content writers will find easy to use, that also allows for full developer customization and use of github plus allowing people with an editor / QA kind of role to be able to see it and make changes before it goes live. Initially I wanted to get django to work but struggled to get it to work on our hosting (though I was new to both django and our hosting provider). Maybe Drupal is an option, though I hear it's got a steep learning curve
5b) OR possibly 6b, depending on timings) Add a website maintenance warning message to protostart.net and r/protostart - so that this will be visible for a little while before we get to step #8
6a) Work towards making what we made in 5a as easy to add and edit content, as it would be in the wordpress site as it is.
7) Make a backup of the wordpress site - or at least the content ans screenshots of the layout and colour scheme.
8) Remove the wordpress site at protostart.net and replace with community built version
