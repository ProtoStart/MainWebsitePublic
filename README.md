# MainWebsite
Our repo for creating our community website.

This will eventually replace our WordPress site at protostart.net and also adds a staging area for our projects, and tools for building. The idea is, this will be a community built website - by our community just for the needs of our community! As of the 20th May 2021 the staging area is live at the subdomain staging.protostart.net

We do also have the domain protostarter.com which in the future we might use for parts of this, but currently it simply redirects to the the staging area, as that is what I had initially said on reddit we would use it for.

Rough plan as it stands: - letters indicate split paths that join up again later
1a) Get some boilerplate stuff together in this repo, - DONE
1b) Get something online at protostart.net - DONE (did with WordPress, so that we made quick visible progress, and also so that I could focus on UX design separately from code)
2b) Improve what was online, to make a really good homepage for us - DONE
3b) Add a bit more content to the live site (so it describes what we're about and shows that we've got projects people can help with) - DONE
4a) Make a permanant homepage for our staging area that explains what that means, and get it online - DONE - though not the way I originially thought - I ran into difficulties with the initial plan, but found a potentially better way to achieve having a staging area - using a subdomain rather than the protostarter.com domain Jbrahms33 got us initially. (did the first draft, reviewed a different day - some improvements made, then another day while trying to figure out how to connect hosting to a domain on someone elses account, I discovered it would be easy, free and actually rather logical to make a staging sub-domain, so I did, and then realised I could link up github to the hosting, so I did).
--- Done to here ---
5) Improve content and process of both the staging area and wordpress parts of the site 
6a) In a directory of the staging area or new subdomain: recreate, and maybe improve upon what is viewable at protostart.net Can use libraries or a more dev friendly CMS than WordPress, or maybe we can extend WP to fit us better?? There must be some way of having a CMS that content writers will find easy to use, that also allows for full developer customization and use of github plus allowing people with an editor / QA kind of role to be able to see it and make changes before it goes live. Initially I wanted to get django to work but struggled to get it to work on our hosting (though I was new to both django and our hosting provider). Maybe Drupal is an option, though I hear it's got a steep learning curve
6b) OR possibly 6b, depending on timings) Add a website maintenance warning message to protostart.net and r/protostart - so that this will be visible for a little while before we get to step #8
6a) Work towards making what we made in 5a as easy to add and edit content, as it would be in the wordpress site as it is.
7) Make a backup of the wordpress site - or at least the content ans screenshots of the layout and colour scheme.
8) Remove the wordpress site at protostart.net and replace with community built version
