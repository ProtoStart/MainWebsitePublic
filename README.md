# MainWebsite
The main website for ProtoStart.

Code to replace our current WordPress site at protostart.net at some point. 
The idea is, this will be a community built website - by our community just for the needs of our community!

We also have a parked domain protostarter.com that we can use as a staging area for this version of the site. When it's ready to replace the WordPress site PGDesign put up as a temporary site, we will.
