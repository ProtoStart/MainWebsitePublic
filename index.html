				<p>This is where we test projects and updates, before they are ready for their own websites</p>
				<p>Projects here can be in any stage of development, <br/> from barely started outlines, right up to betas and even fully working projects that just don't have their own web domain yet</p>

				<p>This is the first release of our staging area, so we don't really have any updates to report yet</p>
				<p>Currently I've built this home page, plus we've got our wordpress site over at protostart.net and a few projects that I hope to get onto our staging area soon</p>
