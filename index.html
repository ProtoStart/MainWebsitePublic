				<p>Testing! Testing!

				<p>22nd May 2021: Phil having another look at staging 
				<p>21st May 2021: Phil made some minor improvements to this staging area, and made a start at getting Solar Rage Asylum staged. SRA is in a very early state with nothing playable just yet, so it's more about being able to rapidly test it as I make it playable over the next week or so. I connected the github to the hosting and tested a link, but I get a 403 forbidden error. I'll have to stop trying for the night as I'm too tired to problem solve now - hopefully I'll get fresh ideas over the weekend.</p>
				<p>20th May 2021: Phil set up the subdomain this is on, set up a redirect from protostarter.com to this subdomain, linked up the github repository to the hosting and made some small improvements to the content of this page.(testing each as he went).</p>
