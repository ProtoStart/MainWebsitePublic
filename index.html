				<p>Our main website for protostart as a community. It explains us, our mission, our ethos; what we're about and how to get involved. I've initially built it using WordPress, since that is a great way to quickly and easy get a website together when you don't require much custom code but do want to put your focus into the words and it looking pretty.</p>
				<p>We might well replace it with something custom, or with a CMS that is more developer friendly (although wordpress is extensible and lots of developers do make plugins for it, so extending the existing site with our own customizations could be an option).</p>

				<p>22nd May 2021: 1) Phil successfully got Solar Rage Asylum staged on a new subdomain specifically for Solar Rage Asylum "beta" mode (it's nowhere near a beta release yet really, but that subdomain can be for it's beta test track). 2)Phil added a community resources section 3) Phil made some changes to the styling - a) scrollbar is now a bit bigger and ProtoStart Purple, b) Purple sections have white text and pink clicked links (so that they stand out on the purple enough) c) changed the classes of some of the sections on the homepage, 4) Phil added link to the list of ways people can help</p>
				<p>21st May 2021: Phil made some minor improvements to this staging area, and made a start at getting Solar Rage Asylum staged. SRA is in a very early state with nothing playable just yet, so it's more about being able to rapidly test it as I make it playable over the next week or so. I connected the github to the hosting and tested a link, but I get a 403 forbidden error. I'll have to stop trying for the night as I'm too tired to problem solve now - hopefully I'll get fresh ideas over the weekend.</p>
				<p>20th May 2021: Phil set up the subdomain this is on, set up a redirect from protostarter.com to this subdomain, linked up the github repository to the hosting and made some small improvements to the content of this page.(testing each as he went).</p>
