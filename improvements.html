				<h2>Staging Area Improvements page</h2>
				<p>Even this staging area is built to our ethos of constantly improving things bit by bit, and involving the community</p>
				<p>This page is used in organising improvements and giving people due credit.</p>

				<h2>General Areas to improve</h2>
				<p>There's allways going to be something that can be improved, and at the moment it should be pretty easy to find something that will make a big difference - we've only recently started working on this. Big areas though:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Styling and readability - making it look nicer, improving wording for better clarity and to keep interest, making it easy to use on every device.</li>
					<li>Process - Anything that can be done to improve the process of collaborating and working on things. Smoother, easier for new people, require less knowledge, faster, easier to be done in odd moments.</li>
					<li></li>
					<li></li>
				</ul>
				
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Item</th>
						<th>Why? what will it help with?</th>
						<th>Priority / timing</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Styling: .ProtoStartPurple divs - black text and default colour links on purple background needs a tweak to avoid low readability colour combinations</td>
						<td>black text on dark purple isn't very readable especially for people with certain types of colourblindness, plus doesn't look great. Also links to visited pages tend to be purple - purple on purple = hard to read.</td>
						<td>Pretty easy to fix when tackling CSS stuff, lump it in with other CSS changes, or do when need something technologically simple to do.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Fix the mobile view</td>
						<td>For some reason it looks tiny, which is odd because most of the CSS was adjusted from code that looks great in TeaRounder</td>
						<td>Fairly soon</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Properly styled todo list tables!</td>
						<td>Make the page look a bit nicer and a bit more professional</td>
						<td>Nice now, likely useful in next few months</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Create/find a good table creation tool</td>
						<td>Putting tables in, and adding rows/collumns is slower than it could be</td>
						<td>Not urgent, but the sooner we have one, the easier it will be to make tables here and in every project</td>
					</tr>
					<!-- Copy the row where you want it - always leave a commented row like this here for convenience next time!
					<tr>
						<td>item here</td>
						<td>why? here</td>
						<td>Priority here</td>

				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>This is the first release of our staging area, so we don't really have any updates to report yet</p>
				<p>Currently I've built this home page, plus we've got our wordpress site over at protostart.net and a few projects that I hope to get onto our staging area soon</p>
