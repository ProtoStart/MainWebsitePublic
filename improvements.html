				<h2>Improvements page</h2>
				<p>This is where we list everything that needs doing here, if any progress has been made on each task, where people can say that they are working on a task.</p>

				<h2>Staging area improvements</h2>
				<p>Want to make our staging area better? Here is our todo list:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Item</th>
						<th>Why? what will it help with?</th>
						<th>Priority / timing</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Properly styled todo list tables!</td>
						<td>Make the page look a bit nicer and a bit more professional</td>
						<td>Nice now, likely useful in next few months</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Create/find a good table creation tool</td>
						<td>Putting tables in, and adding rows/collumns is slower than it could be</td>
						<td>Not urgent, but the sooner we have one, the easier it will be to make tables here and in every project</td>
					</tr>
					<!-- Copy the row where you want it - always leave a commented row like this here for convenience next time!
					<tr>
						<td>item here</td>
						<td>why? here</td>
						<td>Priority here</td>
					</tr>

				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>This is the first release of our staging area, so we don't really have any updates to report yet</p>
				<p>Currently I've built this home page, plus we've got our wordpress site over at protostart.net and a few projects that I hope to get onto our staging area soon</p>
